# ATtiny-LoRa-EnvSensor

I am currently developing a ATTiny1614 + RFM95W + BME280 environment sensor
which will send data to The Things Network via an existing gateway. The new
ATTiny boards support hardware SPI which is what I am using here to communicate
between the uC and different modules.

## Hardware Toolchain

The hardware I selected:

- Self-designed ATTinyX14 Development Board (Schematics to be added)
- RFM95W with antenna
- BME280 3.3v with SPI interface (6-pin board)

Tools I am using:

- Atmel Studio 7
- Atmel-ICE / MPLABÂ® PICkit 4
- Kingst Logic Analyzer
